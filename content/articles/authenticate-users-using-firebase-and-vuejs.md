## Authenticate Users Using Firebase & VueJS

In this tutorial we will work through building a simple VueJS app. It will use Firebase for authentication and allow users to sign-up. Once signed-up, users access protected areas of a web application via a sign-in page.

To keep things as simple and short as possible an assumption is made that you are familiar with VueJS. You can get up and running with a project using the CLI. We will work through two main topics to create our app:

- Using the vue-router to load and protect pages of the web app.
- Set up a Firebase back end that uses Firebase authentication to manage a user sign-up and sign-in.

The tutorial files are free to download on [Github](https://github.com/garethredfern/vue-auth-demo). Where possible, comments have been added to explain what the code is doing. To get the site up and running on your local machine follow the instructions in the README file. The main directory we will be writing our code in is the `src` directory. If you have built VueJS apps in the past, the set-up should be familiar to you.

### App Architecture

The app we are building will have a simple home page where a user navigates to access the site. They will need to sign-up for an account with a sign-up form. Once registered, a sign-in page will enable the user to access a dashboard (the secure area of the site).

### Handling Routes and Securing Pages

The first concept to understand is how to send page requests and secure the pages behind a sign-in. To do this we will use [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/), a first party library for handling routes. To get a good understanding of simple routes we will ignore securing any pages at first. Let’s set up the site structure:

- Home
- Sign-up
- Sign-in
- Dashboard (We will secure this page eventually)
- Error/404 (catch-all page)

There are two main files to review to gain a basic understanding of what the vue-router does. In the `main.js` file we import `VueRouter` and tell `Vue` that you want to use it. Next we create a `VueRouter` instance and pass in the routes that the app will use via a separate `routes.js` file.

Here we also set the mode for the router to `history`, without this set vue-router will load each page with a hash in the URL. In modern browsers we can use the HTML5 History API and remove the need to have the hash in the URL.

There would also be some server config to get this to work, for more info read the [official docs](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#example-server-configurations).

```js
Vue.use(VueRouter);
const router = new VueRouter({ routes: routes, mode: "history" });
```

The `routes.js` file imports all the components that you will display throughout the site. It exports an array of all your routes as objects. Each object has the following key value pairs:

- route name (optional)
- path (the url the user navigates to)
- component (Vue component to load)
-

To explain a little further have a look at the following code:

```js
{
  path: '/sign-in', // set the URL the user will visit
  name: 'signIn', // use this name as a shortcut in your links
  component: SignIn // load the SignIn component
}
```

For each route we repeat the above code and swap out the properties for all our route options. Next we will add the `<router-view></router-view>` opening and closing tags to the `App.js` file. These act as placeholders, telling Vue where to swap out the components when a route path is selected. With this in place you should be able to navigate to each URL and the component for that path will load.

### Securing Routes

The vue-router provides a way to secure routes using Navigation Guards. There are three levels of guard that you can work with:

1. Global guards (what we will use) are set once on the route instance.
2. Per-route guards are set on each route separately.
3. In-component guards are set in each component.

You could opt to use any of these methods but for simplicity we will set the guard to run globally on every page load, this probably has the greatest overhead so just be mindful of this. To get our secure routes working we will check two things:

1. Does the route have a meta property with `requiresAuth` set to true.
2. Is the user logged in and authenticated via the Firebase authentication.

Let’s work through the above points to better understand what is happening. The vue-router has route meta fields where you can add data to retrieve for that particular route. We can use this to set a simple boolean `requiresAuth` for our protected pages:

```js
{ path: '/dashboard', name: 'dashboard', component: Dashboard, meta: { requiresAuth: true }}
```

With the above code in place, we check to see if the route requires authentication before it loads. This check uses the global navigation guard set in the `main.js` file.

```js
router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  const requiresAuth = to.matched.some((record) => record.meta.requiresAuth);
  if (requiresAuth) {
    next("/sign-in");
  } else {
    next();
  }
});
```

Here we are calling the `beforeEach` method on the router instance. It takes 3 arguments, explained in detail in the docs, but the main one to focus on is the `next()` argument. This is where you tell the router what to do when the `requiresAuth` condition is true.

In our application we use it to send the user to the sign-in page. To access the route metadata we are setting a variable that takes the `to` argument (the route we are navigating to). The docs explain how you can access the meta fields that you set:

> All route records matched by a route are exposed on the $route object (and also route objects in navigation guards) as the $route.matched Array. Therefore, we will need to iterate over `$route.matched` to check for meta fields in route records.

With the meta array available to us we can iterate over it using a ES6 function:

```js
const requiresAuth = to.matched.some((record) => record.meta.requiresAuth);
```

We pass the `requiresAuth` into the conditional. If `true` send the user to the sign-in page, if `false` load the page as normal.

It’s worth taking the time to read through the docs. Get a good understanding of what the `beforeEach` method is doing. It is a key principle to understanding route guards. Next we will move on to using Firebase to authenticate the user and add a check to the route guard.

### Authentication With Firebase

Firebase offers a complete backend and authentication system. It can be added to the front end of your web app. For this demo, we will be using its authentication API to allow users to sign-up and sign-in. Once signed in, authenticated users can view protected content. The first thing you will need to do is sign up for an account at [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). I would also suggest watching getting started with [Firebase Auth](https://youtu.be/8sGY55yxicA).

Once you have an account set up, you will need to create a project in Firebase. Rather than go into this, you can read through the docs on Firebase. They provide an excellent set of instructions to get you started. Note that you will need to copy and paste your config settings and swop them in the [project’s main.js](https://github.com/garethredfern/vue-auth-demo/blob/master/src/main.js#L12). Make sure you enable email & password authentication as the sign in method.

With Firebase set up and your config settings added. Let’s look at the final part of the authentication process. Add a second conditional to the route guard’s `beforeEach` method we created earlier.

```js
router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  const currentUser = Firebase.auth().currentUser;
  const requiresAuth = to.matched.some((record) => record.meta.requiresAuth);
  if (requiresAuth && !currentUser) {
    next("/sign-in");
  } else if (requiresAuth && currentUser) {
    next();
  } else {
    next();
  }
});
```

We have added a variable `currentUser`, it returns the current signed-in user from Firebase. If nobody is signed in then it returns `null`. We can use this as the second check in our conditional statement. If both `requiresAuth` and `currentUser` are `true` the route will display the page.

When this condition is not met, then it returns the user to a sign-in page. If the route is not protected using the `requiresAuth` meta tag, the page is loaded as normal and no authentication is required.

### Make Sure Firebase is Initialised Before Loading Vue

Our routes have been set up so that if you have already signed-in then you are redirected to the dashboard page. Unfortunately, this will not happen. The execution of the navigation guard `beforeEach` takes place before Firebase initialisation ends. ** This is an important gotcha.**

### Using VueJS to Handle the Sign-up & Sign-in

We need users to be able to sign-up and sign-in to our app. Take a look at the two Vue components [SignUp.vue](https://github.com/garethredfern/vue-auth-demo/blob/master/src/components/SignIn.vue) and [SignIn.vue](https://github.com/garethredfern/vue-auth-demo/blob/master/src/components/SignIn.vue). They both work similarly, binding the email and password fields to the data property.

The integration with Firebase happens when the `signUp` or `signIn` method is run. These functions are provided by Firebase. We pass in the email and password from the Vue `data` property. On success navigate to the dashboard using the vue-router `replace` method. If any errors occur then an alert with the error message is displayed.

#### SignUp Method

```js
signUp: function() {
  Firebase.auth()
    .createUserWithEmailAndPassword(this.email, this.password)
    .then(() => {
      this.$router.replace("dashboard");
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.log(error.message);
    });
}
```

#### SignIn Method

```js
signIn: function() {
  Firebase.auth()
    .signInWithEmailAndPassword(this.email, this.password)
    .then(() => {
      this.$router.replace("dashboard");
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.log(error.message);
    });
},
```

If you load the site up in your browser you should now be able to sign-up and sign-in. All we need to do now is show the user a sign out link.

### Allowing Users to Sign-out

Take a look at the [Header.vue](https://github.com/garethredfern/vue-auth-demo/blob/master/src/components/Header.vue) component. We can use a Firebase `signOutmethod` which fires when a user clicks the Sign-out button. Then redirect them to the sign-in page with the vue-router `replace` method.

```js
signOut() {
  Firebase.auth()
    .signOut()
    .then(() => {
      this.$router.replace("sign-in");
    });
}
```

Load the site up in your browser and click on the sign-out button. You should now be redirected back to the sign-in page.

### Wrapping Up & Further Learning

Our app now has basic Firebase authentication with some simple vue-router fundamentals added. Next we need to look at how we manage user state. The state helps display content and links depending on whether a user is logged in. After reviewing a few options, it would be a good use case to dive into [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/).
