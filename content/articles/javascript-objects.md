## JavaScript Objects

In this example we are storing the object's properties by value. What this means is that `cb` is stored in memory, when you change the value of box.material to Steel it doesn't change the value of `cb`. Both the `console.log(cb);` will display cardboard as `cb` has stored the value cardboard in memory.

```js
var box = {};

box.material = "Cardboard";

var cb = box.material;

console.log(cb);

box.material = "Steel";

console.log(cb);
```
