## Lambda Expressions vs Anonymous Functions

When learning a functional programming style you will often come across the term **Lambda Expressions** or **Lambda Functions**. In simple terms they are just functions that can be used as data and therefore declared as a value. Let's explore a few examples.

Consider this array of users where each user is stored as an object.

```js
const users = [
  { id: "💻", name: "Gareth", skill: "coder" },
  { id: "🎧", name: "Danny", skill: "DJ" },
  { id: "🕺🏼", name: "Barry", skill: "dancer" },
];
```

### Named Function Declaration

We can use a function declaration to create a named function that can be passed to another function to retrieve some data.

```js
function getUserSkills(user) {
  return user.skill;
}

console.log(users.map(getUserSkills));
```

### Anonymous Functions

You will often see and use anonymous functions as callbacks in other functions. Here we are retuning just the user’s skills as a new array of data. These are great for small tasks where you quickly want to grab some data.

```js
console.log(
  users.map(function (user) {
    return user.skill;
  })
);
```

### Lambda Expression

A Lambda expression is an anonymous function assigned to a variable. Here we assign an ES6 anonymous function to the `getUserSkills` variable. We can then pass the value of `getUserSkills` to be used as data elsewhere in our application. They become really useful when you want to split out more complex functionality into more readable and reusable functions.

```js
const getUserSkills = (user) => user.skill;

console.log(users.map(getUserSkills));
```
