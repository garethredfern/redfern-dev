## Learn Svelte & SvelteKit

A practical course for JavaScript developers ready to learn Svelte. If you're coming from Vue, React, or vanilla JS, you'll find Svelte refreshingly simple.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

- Build reactive UIs with Svelte's compiler-first approach
- Handle state, props, and events without boilerplate
- Create full-stack applications with SvelteKit
- Implement routing, data loading, and form handling
- Deploy production-ready applications

## Prerequisites

- Solid JavaScript fundamentals (ES6+)
- Basic HTML and CSS
- Familiarity with npm/node
- Some experience with any frontend framework helps but isn't required

## How to Use This Course

Each lesson is self-contained with explanations and code examples. For your plane journey, you can read through everything without a computer. When you're ready to code:

1. Create a new SvelteKit project: `npm create svelte@latest my-app`
2. Work through the exercises in each lesson
3. Build something small after each module
